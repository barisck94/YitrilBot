Automation of cryptocurrency trading using certain statistical indicators and oscillators including Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic RSI and Bollinger Bands. While in use, the total value of the assets will sway as the global crypo-market does, though the bot can still be used as a heads-up call to buy or sell.
